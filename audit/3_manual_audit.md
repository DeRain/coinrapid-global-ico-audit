# Manual audit of the code

## Known attacks checklist
- Reentrancy: no
- Cross-function Race Conditions: no
- Transaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD): no
- Timestamp Dependence: no
- Integer Overflow and Underflow: no
- DoS with (Unexpected) revert: no
- DoS with Block Gas Limit: no
- Forcibly Sending Ether to a Contract: no  

## Common issues
1. Funds should not be stored in the contract. The best way - transfer fund on every transaction into multisig wallet.
2. Fallback method too complex. Move all logic into separate method.
3. Replace `transferLimitedFundToAccount` and `transferFundToAccount` methods by the direct transfer of fund on external account/contract (multisig wallet).  
4. Method `resetTokenOfAddress` provides access to all bough tokens from the owner account.
